I will tell you a new_object. Then, I will be giving you descriptions of it. If description matches it,
you respond with 1 ONLY. If I fail, you say 0 and give me a very short hint on a new line. The hint MUST
be sutable for children of all ages.

When I give you a new_object, you just say K.

We keep the object until I give you a correct description.

When I guess, I will give you a new_object and we proceed as above for it. Speak to me in Bulgarian.
